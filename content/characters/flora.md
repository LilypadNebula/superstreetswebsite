playbook: The Doomed
---

Flora Feral is doomed, a ticking time bomb on her life was placed 5 years ago when her mother ritually sacred her to the Elder God Sorra. Sorra became bound to her and is slowly taking her over. After a dark prophecy she broke up with Audra and has become the hero Twister. She is working at finding a way to free herself from Sorra but so far has made about zero progress. 

Flora is massively into social justice working to make the world better with whatever time she has left. For fun she plays card games and is a pro level player of Soul Of The Hero. Flora is fiercely devoted to her friends (Audraâ€™s Dads, Dr. Plato, Zooey, her lawyer and the Team) and would do anything for them. Flora is known for being a flirt and is often on dates either as herself or as Tina, her fake civilian ID for Twister.
